# Hello World in Injective for EVM developers

Demo repo for Hello World on Injective, for EVM developers.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true&editor=code&workspaceClass=g1-standard#https://github.com/injective-dev/inj-evm-hello-world)

<!-- TODO insert github code space links -->

## Time commitment

If you are using Gitpod, this should take you no longer than 10 minutes to complete!

You do **NOT** need to do any of the following:

- Configure an IDE
- Install dependencies
- Write any code

All you really need is a browser and a Github account.
Plus you need to be able to run shell commands.

Note that in the final step, you can see your summary stats,
which will tell you exactly how long you spent on this.
For example:

```text
Summary stats:
- Setup duration    : 1m 37.4s
- Duration for steps: 6m 59.2s
- Steps attempted   : fund (1/2), compile (1/1), test (1/1), deploy (1/1), verify (1/1), interact (1/1)
- Total attempts    : 6
- Completion rate   : 85.7%
```


## Tutorial

This is a demo repo intended to accompany the following series of tutorials:

## Run in browser

**Gitpod**:

- Simply press the "Open in Gitpod" button above!
- Note that you must have a Github account, and must be signed into it.
- Gitpod will automatically create an account for you if this is your first time using it, you must allow Github to connect to the Gitpod app.
- Gitpod is freemium, and is more than enough for the usage levels needed for this Hello World experience.
