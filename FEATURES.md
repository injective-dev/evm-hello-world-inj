## Specific feature for this Hello World

- [x] remove auto jump to line for logSection, instead only do it on begin --> `b3dbaeb`
- [x] open .env and config.json files automatically --> `9c05e03`
- [x] for the "run this script next" outputs, highlight file name with different colour --> `199e8b9`
- [x] for 00-fund, after account lookup include instructions, before "after funding account section" --> `adc78cf`
- [x] when shell command is output, highlight in a different colour --> `896e8ca`
- [x] move the logic for waiting for funds from step 0 to step 3 --> `b1dfef8`
	- [x] step 0 just outputs a warning if there are zero funds --> `b1dfef8`
	- [x] step 3 add the 30s 2nd check logic --> `b1dfef8`
- [x] for 06-stats
	- [x] remove JS object output --> `205864e`
	- [x] completion rate determine why it shows 6/8 instead of 7/8 --> `28fd995`
	- [x] convert seconds to minutes in human readable output --> `8b7da4b`
- [x] step 3 for deploy, link directly to the bytecode tab --> `a70be3e`
- [x] step 5 interact don't output full ABI, just truncate --> `d79680f`
- [x] investigate if there's an additional ethersjs wait needed on the SC interaction transaction --> `da99ce0`
	- feedback to engineering that transaction doesn't appear in block explorer after transaction has happened --> not needed
- [x] for logger waits: include timestamps of *start* of wait and *end* of wait --> `58bd164`
- [x] for all scripts: logs which include a command - change to use a different ANSI colouring --> `b1492c6`
- [x] for util, add new function to run CLI commands --> `0267e7d`
- [x] setup shell, after it is complete --> `513731f`
	- [x] investigate if possible to close a shell in gitpod (perhaps `exit`?)
		- it was `exit` in the `setup` shell
		- plus `gp tasks stop "$( gp tasks list --no-color | grep 'setup' | awk '{print $2}' )"` in the main shell --> ref https://www.gitpod.io/docs/classic/user/configure/workspaces/gitpod-cli#stop-2
	- [x] if possible, switch to main shell after setup shell is closed
- [-] in 00-fund (new script) --> `00616c3`
	- [x] create new script
	- [x] output blockscout URL for account address in output --> `4f0eabe`
	- [x] refactor 03-deploy to replace this
- [ ] feedback to engineering that:
	- faucet needs to be faster to dispense, and
	- even when there's an error message, blockscout URL should be provided to account
	- faucet display transaction should show in blockscout (even after the RPC return value shows that the account balance has indeed increased already)
	- faucet should also include blockscout URL for dispense transaction
- [ ] setup script
	- [x] refactor to shift this function to logger --> `f41d44b`
	- [ ] investigate double input characters upon first prompt --> TODO still unknown, even though now there's only a single instance of `readline` in the entire repo
- [x] at start of main shell: prompt user to start the first script --> `dc03404`
- [x] at the end of each script: prompt user to run the command for the next script --> `dc03404`
- [x] upon each log:
	- [x] investigate if possible to automate line number when using the `code` command
		- use `code --goto "${PATH}:${LINE_NUM}:${COLUMN_NUM}"`
		- note that `file://` must be removed
	- [x] if possible: scroll the script file to the specific line of code for the log for each section --> `3360e89`
- [ ]  at the beginning of each script:
	- [x] open the script file itself in vscode --> `7271477`
	- [ ] add ability to disable this via a flag in config file
- [ ] at end of setup script:
	- [ ] what just happened here: explain the files, where they will be used
	- [ ] open config.json in vscode
	- [ ] open .env file in vscode
- [x] add an 06-stats script
	- [x] analyse time spent --> `f393787`
	- [x] read and parse log files for analysis --> `9dca73b`
	- [x] open the script file itself in vscode --> `7271477`
	- [x] print human-readable summary --> `b8debc6`
	- [x] calculations for setup time --> `6de4806`
	- [ ] include setup buffer time if gitpod is detected
- [ ] logs from yesterday's stale gitpod image (logs.json.txt)
	- [x] extract them before it gets deleted
	- [ ] perform time spent analysis
	- [ ] hold onto it for later comparison
- [ ] at end of 01-compile:
	- [ ] open the counter.json artefact 
	- [ ] what just happened: highlight where the ABI is, and where the bytecode is
- [ ]  in middle of 02-test:
	- [ ] open Counter.test.js
	- [ ] what just happened: describe the tests in the file
- [ ] in 03-deploy
	- [ ] consider moving funding step from 03-deploy to a new 00-fund
	- [ ] what just happened: after deployment, include explanation for why an unverified contract still shows its source code
	- [ ] link to `tab=contract_bytcode` blockscout URL
- [ ] in 04-verify
	- [ ] after verification, open up the source code of Counter.sol so that it is convenient to compare
	- [ ] what just happened: after verification, explain what the ABI and source code are
- [ ] in 05-interact
	- [ ] do not console.log the full ABI
	- [ ] what just happened here: for all 3x interactions (query before, transaction, query after)
	- [ ] rename the outputs to make query before and after more clear
	- [ ] for the transaction output the blockscout URL instead of the hash
